What is the Dynamic Gravity Engine?
=======
This is my engine that is built from the Farseer Physics engine (originally developed by Tinco Andringa), with a few key modifications to suit my purposes. The key changes are to the gravity calculations, but I will go into further detail in later releases. 

What is Farseer Physics Engine?
-------------------------------
Farseer Physics Engine is a collision detection system with realistic physics responses.
This means you can create a game or robotic simulation easily using the engine and
the associated tools. Everything from simple hobby games to complex simulation systems
is possible with Farseer Physics Engine. Download the latest version, checkout our
documentation and watch how other people are using the engine.
